# Getting Started With React Workshop

This is the initial repo for the Getting Started Workshop at Ironhack in May 2016.

Please, if you are going to attend. Download this repo and follow the setup steps

### Steps

1. Download repo -duh! obvious-
2. `$ npm install`
3. Install `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server` and `babel` globally
  - `$ npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server babel`
4. To make sure it's working. Enter the main folder of the repo and run `$ npm start`
5. Open de browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`. You should see nothing. What were you expecting? The whole app already built? We are going to build our own app at the Workshop.
